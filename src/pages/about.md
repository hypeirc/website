# General info

HypeIRC is an IRC network aiming to be a free platform for both
Hyperboria-related and any other discussion as long as you don't
abuse the technical capabilities of the network or do something
that is explicitly illegal in western countries, where our nodes
reside: EU, Canada and USA.

## Connect

All servers listen only inside the [hyperboria network](http://hyperboria.net).

The servers are available with the use of [cjdns] or [yggdrasil].
We have several RDNS domains within the cjdns network, connect to
any of them via port 6667:

* hypeirc.dryware.org
* hypeirc.cjdns.ca

Ygg users can connect to irc.y.dryware.org:6667 directly for now
