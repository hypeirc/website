# General info

HypeIRC is an IRC network aiming to be a free platform for both
Hyperboria-related and any other discussion as long as you don't
abuse the technical capabilities of the network or do something
that is explicitly illegal in western countries, where our nodes
reside: EU, Canada and USA.
